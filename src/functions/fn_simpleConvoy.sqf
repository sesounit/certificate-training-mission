/*
* Author: Tova, modified by Dildo Sagbag
*
* Description:
* Improved version of TOV_fnc_simpleConvoy. Creates a convoy based off a group of vehicles. Once group is deleted, leader is out of the vehicle, or there are no waypoints, then the convoy is restored to normal settings.
* https://forums.bohemia.net/forums/topic/226608-simple-convoy-script-release/
*
* Arguments:
* 0: Group of AI-controlled vehicles to be in the convoy. Follows in the order of units first grouped to the leader. <GROUP>
* 1: Speed of the convoy. Default 50 km/h. <NUMBER>
* 2: Distance of separation between vehicles in convoy. Default 50 m. <NUMBER>
* 3: Push through combat. Default is false. <BOOLEAN>
*
* Return Value:
* None
*
* Example:
* [bobs_group] spawn SESO_fnc_simpleConvoy;
* [bobs_group, 30, 20] spawn SESO_fnc_simpleConvoy;
* [alices_company, 50, 40, true] spawn SESO_fnc_simpleConvoy;
*
* Public: Yes
