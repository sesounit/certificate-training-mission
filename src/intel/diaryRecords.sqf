Panzer Barracks, a future home for Bravo squad, has proved useful. According to our intel, most German forces are housed in Base Sud. They receive supply from headquaters in the north due to the railroad.
<br/><br/>
You will need to eliminate this railroad in OBJ Pegasus using the fuel truck you acquired earlier. Wrap it with explosives and set it to blow in OBJ Pegasus.
